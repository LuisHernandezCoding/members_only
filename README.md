# Members-Only

In this project i will create a members only app with Ruby on Rails. I will use tailwind-css framework for the front-end, and for js used alpinejs but barely used it because it was out of the scope of the project

This is part of the Members-Only Project in The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum.
